# Vanus Connect

Vanus Connect allows you to skip the complex integration with external services by offering out-of-the-box connectors.
Each connector acts as a proxy between outside services and your system, enabling you to have faster integrations with
no codes.
All data produced or processed by our connectors conforms to the CloudEvents specification, which helps enterprises
leverage event-driven architecture to do business in the age of events.
